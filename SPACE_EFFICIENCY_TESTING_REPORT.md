## ðŸ“Š Space Efficiency Metrics (Expected Behavior)

| Sidebar State     | Width | Content Area | Space Efficiency |
| ----------------- | ----- | ------------ | ---------------- |
| Compact Collapsed | 48px  | ~97%         | Optimal          |
| Normal Collapsed  | 64px  | ~95%         | Excellent        |
| Expanded          | 256px | ~82%         | Good             |
| Mobile Hidden     | 0px   | 100%         | Maximum          |

## ðŸŽ® Interactive Features Ready for Testing

### Available Controls:

1. **Sidebar Toggle**: Hover to expand, click to pin
2. **Compact Mode**: Toggle between normal and compact modes
3. **Space Panel**: Show/Hide metrics panel via button
4. **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Ctrl+B (toggle), Ctrl+Shift+B (compact mode)
