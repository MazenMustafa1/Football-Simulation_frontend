- ✅ Event trails showing recent activity
- ✅ Pass and shot trajectory visualization
- ✅ Live score overlay and match progress indicator
- ✅ Event legend and current event details
- ✅ Animated markers and effects for current events

#### 5. **Comprehensive Service Layer**

##### **MatchSimulationService**

- ✅ `getTeamSeasons(teamId)` - fetches team seasons from `/teams/seasons/id`
- ✅ `simulateMatch(userId, matchData)` - starts simulation via `/simulatematch/userId`
- ✅ `trackSimulation(simulationId)` - tracks progress via `/match/simulation/track/simulationid`
- ✅ `getSimulationResult(simulationId)` - gets results via `/match/simulation/result/simulationid`
- ✅ Intelligent caching with different TTLs for real-time vs static data

##### **SignalRService**

- ✅ Real-time connection management with automatic reconnection
- ✅ Hub connection for match simulation events
- ✅ Event handlers for match events, simulation progress, completion, and errors
- ✅ Room management (join/leave simulation)
- ✅ Connection state monitoring and statistics

##### **Enhanced Existing Services**

- ✅ All services optimized with ApiService enhancements
- ✅ Intelligent caching, retry logic, cache invalidation
- ✅ Utility methods and error handling improvements

#### 6. **Technical Infrastructure**

- ✅ Installed SignalR client library (`@microsoft/signalr 8.0.7`)
- ✅ Fixed SSR issues with browser API usage
- ✅ Complete TypeScript interface definitions
- ✅ Proper error handling throughout the application
- ✅ Authentication integration with JWT tokens

### 🔧 **TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS**

#### **API Endpoints Integrated**

- `GET /teams/seasons/{teamId}` - Team seasons retrieval
- `POST /simulatematch/{userId}` - Match simulation initiation
- `GET /match/simulation/track/{simulationId}` - Real-time tracking
- `GET /match/simulation/result/{simulationId}` - Final results
- `WebSocket /matchSimulationHub` - SignalR real-time communication

#### **Caching Strategy**

- **Real-time data**: 2 seconds TTL (simulation tracking)
- **Team data**: 10 minutes TTL (team seasons)
- **Results**: 30 minutes TTL (simulation results)

#### **State Management**

- React hooks for component state
- Context-aware error handling
- Loading state management
- Real-time event synchronization

### 🎨 **UI/UX Features**

#### **Design Elements**

- Gradient styling for simulation components
- Color-coded event types (goals, shots, passes, cards, etc.)
- Smooth animations for event visualization
- Responsive design for all screen sizes
- Interactive playback controls with speed adjustment

#### **Event Visualization**

- ⚽ Goals - Green markers
- 🎯 Shots - Yellow markers
- ➡️ Passes - Blue markers
- 🦵 Tackles - Red markers
- 🟨 Cards - Dark red markers
- 🔄 Substitutions - Purple markers
- 📐 Corners - Cyan markers
- 🦶 Free kicks - Orange markers
